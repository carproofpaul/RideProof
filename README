What is RideProof?
    This app was created to fill the void of vehicle safety in the ride-sharing economy.
    When using services like Uber or Lyft, you are unaware of the actually safety and history of the vehicle it-self. 
    RideProof allows the rider to enter the driver's license plate number (or take a picture of it), 
    and the app will display safety score and brief history summary of the vehicle. 
    This will allows the rider to feel more confortable using the service. 

How it works?
    RideProof has four input methods; License plate number, VIN, picture of the license plate, and text from the clipboard.
    License plate number and vin works the same way, the user enters it manually and the app calls the necessary apis. 
    The license plate requires an additional call to convert it to a vin. For the image input, it gets uploaded to cloudnary
    for storage and then sent to sighthound for OCR.
